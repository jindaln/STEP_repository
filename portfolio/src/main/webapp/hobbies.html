        <h2> Podcasts </h2>
        <p> I've recently developed an interest in sound mixing/editing and have hopped on a podcast called
            The Pioneers: South Asian Firsts in America. Each episode features a prominent South Asian who has made 
            remarkable strides in their respective field. The goal is to highlight the wide array of accomplishments in the South
            Asian community; to show how South Asians are redefining what it means to be a part of the American fabric; and 
            ultimately, to inspire young South Asians to dream big.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Thus far, <i>Pioneers</i> has released four episodes on influential South Asians spanning from Ajit Pai, 
            the Chairman of the FCC, to Vishal Shah, the Head of Product at Instagram. Listening to their stories and the ways
            they have overcome adversity and paved their path has been really inspiring and exciting, as 
            future generations of South Asians have more and more representation of themselves in spaces they didn't before. Personally,
            being able to mix and clean the audio files also gives me an opportunity to go back and listen more closely. By the end of it,
            I've replayed each clip so many times that the interview almost memorizes itself. But in doing so, I learn from the way they speak 
            and articulate their ideas and each repetition, I learn something new that I hadn't caught before and that has been really fun for me!

        <h2> Dance </h2>
        <p> I don't remember a time in my life when I wasn't dancing. When I was young, my mom enrolled
            me in a dance academy in Atlanta, GA called Kruti where I learned Bharatanatyam. After moving to Dallas, TX at the start 
            of high school, I switched to another academy and ended up learning Bharatanatyam for 8 years before quitting to focus more on percussion. 
            Bharatanatyam gave me an opportunity to learn an art form that brought me closer to my culture while also allowing me to express myself
            creatively. Then, in high school, I joined the Dance Company where I learned American dance forms like modern, contemporary, jazz, balet, etc. 
            Upon entering college, I decided to explore Bhangra, an energetic dance native to the state of Punjab. Now, I am the incoming
            captain of the Harvard College Bhangra Team and I have the opportunity to give back to the organization. Since quarantine, I've started a new initiative
            to release footwork tutorials every week so that people around the world can continue to dance and improve their technique at home. I'm excited
            to see what else we do!

        <h2> Percussion </h2>
        <p>
            My music career began with the piano, as it does for many people. I was the poster child of a bad piano student. I never practiced during
            the week and I always dreaded going to my teacher's house because I knew that I would disappoint her. Honestly, probably
            would've been smarter to just practice in order to avoid the anxiety. Anyways, I played piano for several years before 
            switching over to percussion in middle school and that became the center of my attention till I came to college. My older 
            brother actually paved the path for me, being a percussionist who is nationally recognized and someone I really look up to. The
            summer of my sophomore year, I attended the Juilliard Summer Percussion Seminar, and then junior summer I got to learn from 
            incredible musicians through Tanglewood and the National Youth Orchestra. 
            
            These days, I keep up with music in smaller ways by playing with the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra and occasionally performing
            at local college events. But actually, shifting my focus more to academics has not diminished my appreciation for music but actually
            enhanced it! This semester in my world literature class, we read two works that have actually inspired two of the most famous
            musical pieces in the world: Arabian Nights, which inspired Korsakov's Scheherezade, and Candide, which of course, inspired Bernstein's Candide Overture. 
            While reading those pieces, I was able to gain a new appreciation for the symphonies I had played before, drawing connections between the story and 
            the intentions of the composer in establishing certains themes and tones throughout the piece. In the same vein, having a recollection of the music 
            enhances the way I interact with the literature, which has been really rewarding.

        <h2> Harvard Technology Review </h2>
        <p>
            One of the experiences I have really enjoyed in college is writing for the Harvard Technology Review. Namely, 
            I enjoy interviewing faculty members from Harvard/MIT and conversing with them about their work and ideas. For my first piece,
            I interviewed Sarah Newman and we discussed ideas at the intersection of AI and Agency. For my second piece, I took the T down to Beth Semel at MIT where 
            we talked about the intricacies of computational psychiatry and the impact of technology on the healthcare system. And most recently, I interviewed Vijay Iyer, 
            a grammy award-winning jazz pianist, electronic musician, and Harvard music faculty member on the intersection of technology and music. Every opportunity to talk to sometime who has devoted their entire life
            to a particular niche field within technology has been humbling and inspiring and I hope to continue to write and share their ideas with the world during
            my time at Harvard.

        <h2> Reading Group </h2>
        <p> 
           A couple of my friends who are absolute nerds started this computer science and statistics reading group. Every week,
           a group of students comes together to discuss topics from two different related research papers. 
           It's honestly really nice to get exposed to different topics within CS/Stat and 
           to be able to learn about practical applications of the material we learn in class.
           Thus far, we have discussed papers on differential privacy, a field spearheaded by Harvard's very own 
           Cynthia Dwork, and this week we will be looking into the PAC algorithm and Google Spanner, which is
           ironically close to home.
