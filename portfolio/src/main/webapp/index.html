        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p> Welcome to my Portfolio page! My name is Nikita Jindal and I am rising junior at Harvard University 
          studying Computer Science and Statistics with a Language Citation in Hindi-Urdu. This past academic year, I studied both the 
          CS121/124 series on Theoretical Computer Science and Data Structures and Algorithms as well as the 
          Stat 110/111 series on Probability and Statistical Inference. With this foundation, I'm excited to dive
          deeper into classes on Systems and Artificial Intelligence this upcoming semester!</p>

        <p> Outside of class, I love to learn and to express myself creatively in all kinds of ways! I grew up as a musician
            and a dancer, and these days I like to explore different aspects of music through sound editing/mixing for podcasts
            and the like. In my downtime, I enjoy reading short stories, memoirs, and poetry in Hindi and Urdu as well as research papers on various
            applications of ideas in CS/stat. In addition to reading, I also like to talk to experts in various fields and just listen to their
            own articulation of ideas and to their stories of how they reached where they are. On a lighter note, 
            I find it fun to cook and bake with my family and try out random new recipes. I also enjoy taking hikes in
            Colorado under the beautiful sunshine while listening to music or talking to a friend.  </p>

        <p>CompareAsiaGroup (CAG) is a financial technology startup based in Southeast Asia 
            that seeks to financially empower individuals via a financial management platform. 
            During my two month internship, I worked on the following projects.</p> 

        <ul class="cag-list">
            <li> 
                <h3>SMS Gateway</h3>
                <p> Developed an SMS-gateway which enables CAG Marketing to send text messages to 
                    clients with incomplete financial applications. Implemented the gateway via JHipster, 
                    a scaffolding tool which offers an integration of SpringBoot, Swagger, Postgresql, Maven, 
                    and React. The gateway leverages the Twilio API to send sms's and listen for responses via
                     a webhook. If the user responds with certain key words, the webhook triggers an api call 
                     which searches the database for the appropriate unsubscribe urls and makes a rest call to 
                     an internal microservice to alter the user's subscribe status.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3>FB Messenger Chatbot</h3>
                <p> Developed an MVP Facebook Messenger chatbot which utilizes the Wit.ai NLP engine and the 
                    Botkit.ai framework to interact with clients purchasing personal loans in Malaysia. 
                    Crafted a flow where the chatbot can sift through qualified leads based on personal loan 
                    history and capture the client's personal information for future contact. Additionally, 
                    recorded a demo of the MVP which marks the first demo to be uploaded to the new CAG Youtube 
                    Channel, an initiative aimed at increasing visibility of projects within the company.</p>
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3>IMDB React App</h3>
                <p> Redesigned CAG's front-end developer interview process by building a two-page react node 
                    application which uses React hooks and styled components to simulate the IMDB movie interface 
                    via their TMDB api. Thereby, optimized the interview process for time efficiency such that 
                    prospective candidates can implement a single additional feature as opposed to building the 
                    web app from scratch as a gating task in there interview process.</p> 
            </li>
            <li> 
                <h3>Partner Portal</h3>
                <p>Implemented login functionality for the Partner Portal, a digital platform that manages user access 
                    to highly secure PII for both internal CAG members and external providers. Through Okta's OAuth 2.0 
                    authorization server and related OIDC provider, enabled multi-factor authentication and implemented the 
                    authorization code PKCE grant flow. Developed the POC for the Partner Portal using the Fuse-React 
                    template which was then integrated with Jhipster.</p>
